Director Ring Modifications
===========================

A new director server is added by:

* Add the server to :ref:`setting-director_servers` so that the director is
  remembered even after a cluster restart.
* ``doveadm director ring add`` command can be used to add the director to an
  already running ring.

A director server can be removed with ``doveadm director ring remove``. You
can see the current ring state with ``doveadm director ring status``.
